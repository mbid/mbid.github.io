<p>This post is about the my recent rewrite of Eqlog’s type checker in
Eqlog itself.</p>
<p>I finished prototyping a Hindley-Milner style type checker using
Eqlog a while ago TODO:link. Type checking is one of the supposed killer
applications of Datalog and especially Eqlog, and so it’s only fair to
expect that Eqlog’s type checker is also written in Eqlog.</p>
<p>I don’t want to go into too much detail, since a lot of what is
entailed by implementing a type checker in Datalog or Eqlog is not
particularly specific to Eqlog’s type system: We need to encode the AST
emitted by the parser in a relational format so that it can be consumed
by Eqlog, and, propagate data such as ambient symbol bindings through
the AST and collect typing constraints on variables. To avoid confusion,
I’ll refer to the Eqlog program that models Eqlog’s type system as
“eqlog.eql”, whereas “Eqlog” refers to the Rust executable that compiles
<code>.eql</code> files into Rust source code and happens to embed
<code>eqlog.eql</code>.</p>
<h2 id="locations-error-messages">Locations &amp; error messages</h2>
<p>A generality that I do want to remark on is generating error
messages, since I completely left this part out in the series on
Hindley-Milner type checking. To be easily actionable, error messages
must be associated with a location in the input source code. And to have
access to locations also after parsing, we need to save locations along
with AST nodes. The approach Eqlog uses here now is to associate each
AST node a <code>Loc</code> element representing a location in source
code:</p>
<pre class="eql"><code>type Loc;
func type_decl_node_loc(TypeDeclNode) -&gt; Loc;
func pred_decl_node_loc(PredDeclNode) -&gt; Loc;
...</code></pre>
<p>Like all Eqlog types, <code>Loc</code> is actually just an integer ID
under the hood. The actual source code range that a <code>Loc</code>
represents is given by a <code>Map&lt;Loc, (usize, usize)&gt;</code>
that is maintained in Rust, outside of <code>eqlog.eql</code>. Ideally,
Eqlog would support some kind of “external” types and provide this
mapping for us, but for now we have to maintain it manually.</p>
<p>Now to the interesting part about error messages in Eqlog: Sorting
and prioritizing error messages.</p>
<p>In traditional compiler, there’s a usually natural ordering in which
it encounters an error in the input source code. For example, the
compiler might have a name resolution phase, which reports errors about
undeclared identifiers, followed by a type inference phase, which
reports errors about ambiguous types. Within each phase, or even when
the compiler checks multiple properties in the same pass (i.e., in the
same traversal of the AST), it will typically encounter the error that
originates from the earliest position in the input first.</p>
